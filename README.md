This is the directory for my Bot Discord. Its goal is to facilitate teachers, teaching courses in distenciel on this platform. 
This bot adds many new features that do not exist on discord, for example mute all the microphones of the vocal channel in one command (and vice versa), 
ask permission to speak (raise your hand), or work tools like the "pomodoro" method . What inspired me to create this bot is my old high school math teacher, 
who continues to teach in distence. I hope this bot will be satisfactory for him and his work.
